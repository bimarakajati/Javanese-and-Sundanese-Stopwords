# Javanese-and-Sundanese-Stopwords
This project aims to provide stopwords for the Javanese and Sundanese languages, which are translated from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) Indonesian stopwords. Stopwords are common words that are often removed from text during text analysis and natural language processing to improve the quality and efficiency of linguistic analysis.

# Disclaimer:
The translations of stopwords from Indonesian to Javanese and Sundanese are generated using automated translation services and may not be perfect. Users are encouraged to review and improve the translations as needed.
